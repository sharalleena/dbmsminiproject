                This mini project is academic related project where students can get study materials and referral links.
                This will be helpful for students while studying. When semester ends students will have many textbooks, notes, study materials, question papers etc.
                As well as they know which links on internet were useful.When new semester begins students have to find textbook or other study materials through browser, which leads in spending lot of time on internet We are going to develop a website for our college ,If any student wants to sell these materials or donate it, they can upload information ,and who are in search of study materials can search it.
